# preferences.json

## Overview

The `preferences.json` file holds options specific to the User and Data version that the Launcher will be using.

For deployment it is recommended to not ship with a `preferences.json` file, but instead to ship with `.preferences.default.json`. This will allow the preferences file to regenerate using the default file as a partial override to the existing defaults.

**Root folder** refers to the folder where `/Data` is located in most instances (see [config.json](config)), where your version specific data will be kept.
